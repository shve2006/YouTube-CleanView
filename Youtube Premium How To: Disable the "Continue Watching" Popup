 But the "Continue Watching" popup in premium was driving me crazy, and many of the top search results solutions didn't work.

Just thought I'd post this here in the hopes it can help someone else.

    Install Tampermonkey or similar userscripts extension (Chrome store - search Tampermonkey)

    Enable developer mode (Manage extensions -> click top right)

    Click tampermonkey, add new script

    Paste this script and save: https://openuserjs.org/scripts/ballerburg9005/Disable_YouTube_Miniplayer/source

    And the annoying popup should be gone.

    This works by killing the miniplayer entirely, so if you like that but want the popup gone you might be SOL.
